# LinkRefine: Polish Your LinkedIn Presence

**LinkRefine** is a web application that helps users refine and optimize their LinkedIn profiles. By simply providing a **LinkedIn profile URL**, the tool fetches and analyzes **profile data (such as the userâ€™s headline, about section, work experience, skills, and more)**, and then offers **AI-driven suggestions** on how to improve each section. This makes it easier for professionals to present their expertise more effectively, attract recruiters, and stand out in their network.

### Usage Guide

1. **Uploading Your Profile URL:**  
   - Navigate to the Upload page where you will see an input field prompting you to enter your LinkedIn profile URL.
   - Enter your URL and click the "Upload" button.
   - The frontend sends a POST request to the `/linkrefine/upload` endpoint, which triggers the backend to process the URL.

2. **Processing and Redirect:**  
   - The backend processes the profile URL, generates a unique `link_id`, and returns it upon successful processing.
   - The frontend stores this `link_id` in localStorage and then automatically redirects you to the Review page.

3. **Reviewing AI Suggestions:**  
   - On the Review page, a GET request is made using the stored `link_id` to fetch your processed profile data.
   - The page displays your original profile information along with AI-generated suggestions for improving sections like your headline, about section, work experience, and more.
   - Each section includes detailed suggestions and improvements to help enhance your LinkedIn profile.
